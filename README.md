# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses a RandomForest classifier to predict survival on the Titanic. It is based on a binary classification problem where the goal was to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not, based on various personal attributes and information.

**The final accuracy obtained was 81.46%.**

## Main Steps Involved

The dataset was acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and feature engineering, which included grouping ages into categories, assigning numerical values to categorical data, and extracting more important information.
Data Visualization: Used matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing data distributions and relations between different features.
Model Development & Evaluation: Built a Random Forest Classifier and evaluated the model using a validation set.
